    <h1> Yohanna Konardi's Excersise 1 </h1>
    
    <p> I am currently a volunteer at Curiodyssey as an LIT, and I have a job at the exploratorium. I really like learning about things in the field of STEM, and I joined a robotics team to do so. While getting exposure to the technichal side of robotics there, I also served as the business lead in our team, B.R.E.A.D. Please visit our website, <a href="www.team5940.org"> here.</a></P>
    <p>This is a webpage created for testing purposes only. Please enjoy this terrible piece of poetry written by me.</p>
    <p> They call me Yoyo, <br>
        My real name is Yohanna, <br>
        This is a haiku. <br></p>
    <p> Would you like to hear another one?</p>
     <p> I am a turle. <br>
        I AM NOT A DANG TORTOISE <br>
        I am a turtle. <br></p>

    <p> P.S... My favorite color is indigo. I couldnt choose between red, blue, and purple, so I mixed all three of them and got the lovely shade that is your background.</p>
